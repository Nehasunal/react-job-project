vite is built on esbuild, it is a bundler

1. npm create vite@latest
2. we have changed the port in vite.config.js file using server object : server: {port:3000}
3. npm install -> to install dependencies

===> Hot Module Replacement (HMR): When you make changes to your React components during development, Vite only reloads the parts of the app that changed, without refreshing the entire page. This gives a very fast feedback loop.

START: FOLDER structure
1. It is SPA(single page application), so index.html loads in browser.
2. <div id="root">: This is the placeholder where your entire React app will be injected.
   React will "take over" this div element and render the app's components inside of it.
3. <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>: This is where Vite links to the main.jsx file (the main entry point of your React app). 
   Vite uses modern JavaScript modules (type="module") and takes care of loading and bundling files efficiently.
4. Once index.html loads, it directs the browser to the main.jsx file (the entry point for your React code). 
   This is where React starts initializing the app.
5. ReactDOM.createRoot: This is to create a root where React can render the application. Itâ€™s attached to the div with the id root that we defined in index.html.
   root.render(<App />): This line tells React to render the App component (and everything inside it) into the root div. 
6. App.jsx component is the root component of your application. All other components are typically nested inside this one. 




===========================================================================================
Every component returns jsx.
It will return only single element
